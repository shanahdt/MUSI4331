Motives and Melody
========================


Developmental Repetition
-----------------------------

Motivic repetitions whose pitch and/or 
rhythmic content are significantly altered. 
Although developmental repetitions may not 
be as audible as modified repetitions, 
they are often quite important, as they lead to growth in the 
composition, and allow for motion.

Single Interval Motives
-------------------------------

Last week we saw an example of a single interval motive 
when we analyzed Debussy’s ‘Des pas sur la neige.’ 
Let’s look at another example of a single interval 
being used as a motivic device.  

Note how Brahms doesn’t break the pattern of 
falling thirds, except once for range issues.
