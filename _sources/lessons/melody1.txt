Motives and Melody
========================


Developmental Repetition
-----------------------------

Motivic repetitions whose pitch and/or 
rhythmic content are significantly altered. 
Although developmental repetitions may not 
be as audible as modified repetitions, 
they are often quite important, as they lead to growth in the 
composition, and allow for motion.

Single Interval Motives
-------------------------------

Last week we saw an example of a single interval motive 
when we analyzed Debussy’s ‘Des pas sur la neige.’ 
Let’s look at another example of a single interval 
being used as a motivic device.  

Note how Brahms doesn’t break the pattern of 
falling thirds, except once for range issues.

          Example 4: Chopin, Op.28, No.4 (*Prelude* in E minor)

Melodic Writing and Analysis
-----------------------------------

Intervals don’e exist in isolation, but 
rather they function as part of larger 
musical constructs, such as a melody. 
Let’s listen to a few melodies 
and ask the following questions:

Is the melody in a key, how do we know, and why?
Do the melodies have a specific shape or contour?
What sorts of melodic intervals occur between pitches?
Are there accented events in the melodies 
(such as instances that draw your attention, such 
as leaps, chromaticism, and longer durations? 
If so, are these events isolated, or does 
the composer prepare them in so way?

Melodic Reductive Analysis
--------------------------------

Look for stepwise motion that connects 
the beginning of a phrase with its melodic cadence.
Begin by labeling the scale degree of the melodic cadence.
Identify the scale degree of the beginning of the phrase. 
Look for what we might call “structural tones.”

In the following example, we are able to see a structural 
descent of a third. The D on the downbeat, 
descends to a C at the onset of m.3, and B-flat on m.5.

          Example 6: Reduction 

This can be elongated throughout a longer phrase. 
As we see in this Mozart example, there is a 
descending “5-line” over the course of the phrase.
