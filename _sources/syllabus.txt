Course Objectives
=================

Music 4331 is the final course in the three-semester music theory 
curriculum at UVa. In this course, we will continue to explore 
Western tonal music through analysis and model composition. We will
examine elements of sonata theory, chromaticism, the analysis of 19th and 
early-20th century music, and many other topics.

Upon completion of this course, you should have developed many new 
skills that will help you to relate more richly to music by better 
understanding the structure and building blocks of music.

Musicianship is a co-requisite course for Theory 3. Your Musicianship section 
(whether MUSI 3332, 3334, or 3336) will not be definitive until 
after you have taken the required placement exam. 
This placement exam will be held on Wednesday, August 29, 
from 12:00 to 12:50 in OCH 107. Please email the Musicianship instructor, 
Adam Carter (acc8v@virginia.edu) with any questions.

Enrollment deadlines: The last day in the College to add a course is Tuesday,
September 10th; the last day to drop a course is Wednesday, September 11th; 
the last day to withdraw from a course is Tuesday, October 22nd.

Materials
=========


Scores 
---------

*Sonatas and Fantasies for the Piano*, by W. A. Mozart (Dover publication). 
Available at the University Bookstore or online.

Manuscript Paper
------------------

Any manuscript paper will suffice for this class. 
Free manuscript paper can be downloaded as a 
PDF from Perry Roland's UVa site: http://people.virginia.edu/~pdr4h/

A PDF file for staff paper is also always available on Collab Materials for this class.

Please bring blank music manuscript paper to every class; you will need to 
bring your Mozart score only when requested. Additional materials—assignments, 
worksheets, review sheets, and sound files—will be posted on this website and/or Collab. 

Website
=======

The course website can be found at http://shanahdt.github.io/MUSI4331/. 
This site contains lectures, course materials, supplementary readings, 
quizzes and assignments **for self assessment**, and helpful links. 
It is intended to complement, rather than replace, Collab.


Assistance
============

I am available and interested in talking with you about the course,
the course material, and strategies to enhance your learning. 
We can usually have brief discussions after class, and I am able 
to answer questions by e-mail (dts9h@virginia.edu) at any time. 
Additionally, I am happy to eith meet during office hours, or 
set up an appointment at a time that is 
mutually acceptable for more lengthy discussions. 


Attendance
=============

This class depends on interactive discussion, and should be considered 
more a lab than a lecture course. As such, attendance is crucial. 
You are expected to attend every class and attendance will be taken
at the beginning of each meeting. If you know in advance that 
you cannot attend, please contact me by email as soon as possible. 
I will not penalize you for a few absences, but a pattern of absences 
will cause your grade to drop. Please do not skip class simply 
because you have not completed your homework.


Classwork, Homework, and Grading
================================

Assignments are due at the beginning of class. Late assignments 
will be docked points according to the number of days (24-hour timespans) 
from the official due date. For example, if you hand in a “B” quality 
assignment within 24 hours after the official due date, 
the beginning of the previous class, the grade will be adjusted 
to a “B minus.” Place late assignments into my department box, which is 
located in the Music Department office (Old Cabell Hall, First Floor). 
Whenever you place something into my department box, please notify me by email. 
Otherwise, I will not know to look for it, especially because my office is 
located in a galaxy far, far away.

Each of you will be paired with another classmate to present your homework 
once on one of the Thursdays during the semester, starting on September 5th. 
In addition to the copy of the homework that you hand in to me, 
you are responsible for making a copy for every other member of 
the class, so make sure to planning copying time into your preparation.

Begin your presentation by asking the class a series of questions that 
will get them to think about the assignment and explain how they approached it. 
You will then distribute your own solutions, explain them, and solicit responses. 
You should plan for your presentation to take only 10 minutes, but follow-up questions
are likely to go on for a bit longer.
Your oral presentation counts as one homework grade, separate from the grade 
you receive on the homework itself. Try to present as well as possible: be prepared, 
be strategic about the way you use your audio-visual aids (slideshows, if preferred), 
speak loudly and clearly, and use the appropriate terminology. 
You're the instructor for the moment,
so teach as well as possible!

I am happy to meet with you beforehand to go over your presentation.
Before meeting with me and certainly before presenting in class, 
you should also convene with your partner, 
discuss the assignment together, and plan out the presentation.

Grades will be given as percentages out of 100 and will be 
applied to daily work (homework and presentations) and the final project. 
The final grade is based upon the following proportion: 

- 30% for attendance and participation 
- 40% for daily work, 
- 30% for the final project. **The UVa Honor Code is in effect at all times.**

Final Project
=============

For your final project, you may choose to write either an 
analysis paper or a model composition. You may find models 
for your composition among any of the pieces and forms we 
will have studied during the semester; to help you write an 
analysis paper, I will provide you with a sample essay of my own. 
I will schedule short meetings with each of you to go over drafts 
for final projects during the week of Monday, November 26. 
Final Project Proposals are due by email at noon on Monday, 
October 29. Final projects must be completed and submitted by 
Tuesday, December 11 at 5pm, but may also be delivered to my 
box at any time before the deadline.
